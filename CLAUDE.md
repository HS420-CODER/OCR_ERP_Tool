This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new/empty project directory. No codebase exists yet.

## Development Rules

1. **Plan first**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md`, get approval before implementing
2. **Simplicity**: Minimal changes, impact as little code as possible
3. **Root cause**: Find and fix the actual bug, no temporary patches
4. **Auto-commit**: Commit after each completed task with descriptive message
5. **New features**: Create a branch for each new feature
